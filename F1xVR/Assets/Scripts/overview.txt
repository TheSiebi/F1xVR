Cars:
For the cars we need some kind of license to get the meshes. Then we can maybe work to get a different texture overlay

Maps:
We can use blosm and Google Maps API to generate maps of the tracks. This will likely not even cost any money as Google provides a budget for people to use.


OpenF1 API:
https://openf1.org/
This is the center piece of what needs to be developed. Understand the API's abiltiies, position the cars accurately on the track and ensure smooth running.
We don't have to start with actual models of cars but could just have dots running around for now. The most important thing is to get a framework up and running.
